# 🧠 n8n Workflows by Flowtrica

Welcome to a collection of curated, real-world automation workflows built using [n8n](https://n8n.io) — focused on reducing manual work, eliminating errors, and streamlining operations.

Each workflow in this repo is designed to be:
- 🔧 Practical — solves actual business problems
- ✨ Readable — clear logic, meaningful labels, and documentation
- 🧩 Adaptable — easy to reuse or build upon
- ✅ Quietly exceptional — workflows that just work

- Utility functions and helper nodes for common patterns
- Inline documentation and config instructions
